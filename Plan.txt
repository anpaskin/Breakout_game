Aaron Paskin Breakout Game Plan

1. Interesting Breakout Variant: I thought that the asteroids level 
	of PowBall was interesting because it incorporates obstacles for
	the paddle to avoid, an element that I had not previously seen in
	a Breakout game.
	
2. Levels: ('-': default block, '2': 2-hit block, 'r'/'b'/'g'/'y': red/blue/green/yellow
	colored pair blocks, 't': traveling block, '.': ball, '===': paddle,
	'|': wall)
	Level 1:
		|---------------|
		|- - - - - - - -|
		| - - - - - - - |
		|- - - - - - - -|
		|               |
		| 		.	    |
		| 	 ===        |
	
	Level 2:
		|y - - 2 2 - - y|
		|- b - 2 2 - b -|
		|- g - 2 2 - g -|
		|- - r 2 2 r - -|
		|               |
		| 		.	    |
		| 	 ===        |
		
	Level 3:
		|ttttttttttttttt|
		|b-2-2-2-2-2-2-b|
		|g2-2-2-2-2-2-2g|
		|r-2-2-2-2-2-2-r|
		|               |
		| 		.	    |
		| 	 ===        |
		
	Level 4:
		|ttttttttttttttt|
		|ttttttttttttttt|
		|ttttttttttttttt|
		|---------------|
		|               |
		| 		.	    |
		| 	 ===        |
	
		
	Levels 4-6: Repeat designs of Levels 1-3 in order, replacing all
		default blocks with 2-hit blocks.

3. Block Types:
	2-Hit Blocks: blocks that require two collisions to be destroyed
	Traveling Blocks: blocks that move to an open location after first
		collision (and are destroyed after the second); if there are no
		open locations, block is not affected
	Colored Pairs: two blocks on the screen share a color; when one is
		hit, that block turns into the default block and the other block
		that shared its original color is destroyed

4. Power-Ups: *all power-ups last for thirty seconds
	Long Paddle: paddle length increases
	Lazer Paddle: shoots lazers when key is pressed, lazers collisions
		have the same effect as ball collisions
	Sticky Paddle: ball is caught when it lands on paddle; ball is
		released when key is pressed

5. Cheat Keys:
	1-6: jump to corresponding level
	R: reset level
	L: add a life
	P: pause
	
6. I plan to add a reward system that rewards a player with power-ups
	when they gain certain achievements such as destroying ten blocks
	between two paddle rebounds, not losing a life in a level, etc. This
	system adds more depth to the gameplay beyond just completing the
	levels.
